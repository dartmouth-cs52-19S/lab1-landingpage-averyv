# CS 52 Lab 1 - Build a Landing Page
## Avery Vanacore

### Description:
For the first lab, I mimicked different parts of the style and structure of the Starbucks and Blue Bottle Coffee landing pages to create my own landing page for StarBuch, a cafe that sells Kombucha.  I took the navigation bar, main image, and footer from Starbucks, and the article section from Blue Bottle Coffee.  I used at w3schools.com as a resource for HTML and CSS syntax and methods.

__What worked:__  I struggled considerably with flexboxes; originally, my code consisted of a mixture of random display:flex, display:in-line, and display: block.  After stepping away from the code and thinking more about the basic structure of the page, I was able to get the flex display to work.  Additionally, I am very proud of the hamburger menu in the smaller screen version of the webpage.  

__What didn't work:__  I put some time into trying to add the Link Headers (using the CSS Checkbox hack) but wasn't able to figure that out.

### Special features and (potential) extra credit by section:

__General:__

1. The cursor becomes a pointer when hovering over any link in the page.

__Navigation bar:__

1. On hover, the logo in the navigation bar expands and rotates.
2. On hover, the tabs in the navigation bar change color so that the background is black, and the text is white.
3. In the narrow version of the webpage, the navigation bar becomes a drop-down menu.  The menu label icon becomes an "X" when the menu is open.
